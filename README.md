# Using Time Series Analysis for Sales & Demand forecasting
The objective of this project was to identify sales patterns that demonstrate seasonal trends or any other traits, providing insights to inform reordering, restocking, and reprinting decisions for books based on their ISBN. Forecasting book sales and modelling demand was achieved by applying a range of time series analysis techniques - ARIMA, Deep Learning, and Hybrid Methods.


## 🟡 Data
The project utilised two datasets from Nielsen's BookScan repository:
* ISBN list containing industry-standard metadata about each book
* UK weekly trended timeline containing sales data

The data was filtered on books with sales beyond 01-07-2024, producing a list of 61 unique ISBNs, from which two were chosen for in-depth analysis: The Alchemist & The very hungry Caterpillar.
